## FAQ

**How do I choose the right survey software for my small business?**
Start by identifying your main goal—is it customer satisfaction, lead generation, or market research? Then look for a tool with a user-friendly interface and a free or low-cost plan that covers your initial needs.

**Can online surveys really improve the quality of customer feedback?**
Absolutely. A well-designed, engaging survey makes people more likely to respond thoughtfully. Tools that use conversational formats or smart logic can prevent survey fatigue and gather more honest, detailed answers.

**What is the main difference between a survey and a form?**
Think of it as intent. A form is typically for collecting specific information to complete a transaction or action (e.g., a registration form). A survey is designed to gather opinions, ratings, and feedback to measure sentiment or collect data for analysis.
